    <h3>The truth about Winter Break</h3>
        <p>It all started when the school bell rang at 3 o'clock, on the last school day of the year. It was a stormy day, clouds grey enough to drown out the sound of thunder. But the continuous screams of excitement from both teachers and students was enough to blow any storm away. The clouds cleared. In that clearing sat the sun, a bold signal to show that all can be conquered. But no one even glanced at the sun, they were way to excited to pause and look up. They all ran, a stampede of rhinos, charging for the exit. No one knew any better. It was "vacation" after all. Running home to watch the latest "Logan Paul" video or something. Little did they know what "the famous Logan Paul" would do in just two weeks.</p>
