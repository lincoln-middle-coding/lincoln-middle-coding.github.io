<p> Hi how are you this is my second page. We are going to talk about SLIME!</p>
<p> Slime is a very fun object you can make tricks with it. There are many ways you can make slime.
But I am going to tell you how to make slime using: Glue, Shaving Foam, Food Dye, and Lens soultion as the actavator.
First you get a cup and pour in anough to cover the botem of the cup but add more or less depending on the size you want the slime to be.
Then you add saving foam to the glue it should fill about half the cup. Then you need to add Lens soultion so it does not stick to much.
During the process you can add more Lens soultion if you find it to sticky. After that get your Food Dye and add any color you want.
Next you take it out of the cup and then mix it in your hands and that makes slime. Thanks for reading bye.
