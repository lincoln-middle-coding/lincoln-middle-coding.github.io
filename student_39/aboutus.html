<h1> About Legend Box Builds </h1>
  <h2> How did we start </h2>
<p> We started in October when someone asked a few of us to make a full set of armor. After 25 hours over the course of 16 days we had completed our project. <br> But after we had finished, we decided that we were going to sell it instead of giving it out for free. <br> After selling the set of armor, we realized our potential for making objects out of cardboard. and decided to create a small business. People started coming to us and asking us for cardboard toys, weapons, and clothing. <br> We started this website a month after LegendBoxBuilds originated and want to share our story.</p>

  <h2> Our Mission </h2>
  <p> Our mission is to recycle boxes and put them to good use. <br> Many people throw away boxes. But, if we could not only recycle boxes, but make objects out of them! <br> We are trying to create toys for less fortunate kids. We want to use the money you use to buy our creations to create and give. <br> We are trying to help the environment while helping others. </p>
