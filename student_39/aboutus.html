<h1> About Legend Box Builds </h1>
<p>We started in 2018 in Febuary. We sold a full armor package that took over 28 hours to create. <br>. We applied multiple layers of paint and paper. <br>To finish the look off we added scars and cool. After that, we have been everything from Katanas to toy cars to Jets!</p>
  <h1> Our Creators </h1>
  <p>Jet Jadeja started this. He started the idea and made armor. After showing it to the rest of us, we decided to create the idea. Dylan Grunig is also very important. He loves the idea of Legend Box Builds and supports Legend Box Builds!</p> 
  <h1> Events </h1>
  <p> We haven't had any events but we have already been planning building competition. We aren't the only ones who make. </p>
