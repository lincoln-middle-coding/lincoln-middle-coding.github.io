<h2> 3. Inventist Orbitwheel Skates</h2>
<p> 
Orbitwheels are a cross between a casterboard and a pair of inline skates, combining the best features of each. To ride, just step into the hollow wheels, which encircle and rotate sideways around each of your feet. Using a rhythmic wave motion, each foot moves independently, allowing you the freedom to turn and accelerate in unusual ways.

Learning the Orbitwheel wave propulsion technique is enjoyable. Once you master the basics, you’ll find that Orbitwheels are designed for amazing tricks and turns that seem to defy the laws of physics. Catch the Orbitwheel wave!
