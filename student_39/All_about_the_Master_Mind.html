<p> Confusing right? <br> Well actually it is just saying that I know that you know something. <br> But it grows when you realize that I know <br> that you know. So then it grows <br> to I know that you know that I know something.<br>  When I realize that you know that I know that you know that <br> I know about that thing, it grows! Cool right! </p>

			<p> So Dylan, our stupid department leader had a really dumb riddle that is exclusively in the book. <br> There are 2 villages, the Village of Truth and the Village of Lies. <br> You want to go to the village of truth. You find a pathway going in opposite directions. <br> They go to the villages. There is a man. You can ask him 3 questionsions. <br> What village are you from? <br> "I am from the village of truth" <br> Which way is the village of truth? <br> "Right" <br> What is your question. Keep in mind, the villagers in the village of truth, only tell the truth and the villagers from the village of lies can only tell lies <br> What is your next question? </p>
