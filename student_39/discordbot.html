<h1> Hey guys! My name is Ferrari Bot!!!! </h1>
<h2> I am an awesome bot that helps you use discord </h2>
<p> So, what is a discord bot? According to the internet and discord the difference between a bot and a user is that  Bots within the Discord API are a separate type of users that are owned by applications (which are owned by users), and authenticate to the system using a token rather than a username and password.
<p> So you want to learn how to use me! <p>
