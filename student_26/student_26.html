    <li> Property Brothers: Buying & Selling
     <li> Drew and Jonathan Scott are the subjects of this topic that you are looking at.  Let me start by telling you about each one and their functions: Drew Scott is a real estate agent.  He helps families find their perfect fixer-uppers, or better homes.  Drew also talks numbers, like how much money it will cost to buy and sell their new, renevated houses.  Jonathan Scott is a license contractor/house renevator.  He discusses with families about how their houses are, then tells them how he's going to fix them, to look better, with modern furniture, better backsplashes for kitchens, better flooring and so on. /li>
