Dear Blog,
Today we woke up and had light cereal and oatmeal for breakfast. Then we got in the car and drove on ocean street south through all the beaches until we reached Marina del Rey. Here we searched for a place to have clam chowder for breakfast. We reached a fork in the road and we took the path to Fisherman’s Wharf. There my mom and I parked the car and took a walk around the stores while admiring the seals and giant pelicans. We came upon a cute restaurant called Whisky Red that was said to have clam chowder, so we went there. To enter you crossed a bridge surrounded by koi fish. Inside there was a glass room with a table having a perfect ocean view that we occupied. I got a lemonade that I put in my to go Starbucks cup, while mom had a coffee. We ordered two enjoyable clam chowders, but the calamari was soggy and thick, which we returned. We then walked around in pursuit of a nice gift shop but they were all closed so we went to The Point mall. There we saw metal statues and we took a bathroom break. On the way home we stopped by an in-and-out where we got a milkshake a burger and French fries that our waiter had almost mistaken to have no salt. As we departed home we told dad of our travels before having a Panini dinner and finishing the night with a game of Mancala. 
Until tomorrow,
Melodie

				Dear Blog,
Today we woke up and ate a scrumptious breakfast of avocado-and-cheese sandwich with a glass of cold milk. Then we rushed out of the house to reach my Physical Therapist in time. Soon after, we drove to downtown LA where we skipped our planned visit to The Broad Museum that had a huge line and instead we went to The Grove. The parking had a red carpet and  an alleyway leading to the main attraction. We first explored the area to find our way around. We went on the bridge over the pond and found a statue of a boy fishing. Behind the pond was a giant Christmas tree and a Santa Claus riding a sled airborne attached with wires. We found a cute cafe where I saved us a sofa window seat while mom bought the pastry’s, and later a smore that I discovered a kid eating. The smore was on a neatly cut stick, and was torched in front of you. It was filled with cold vanilla ice cream surrounded with chocolate wafer and marshmallow. After the treat we found a Sephora where we used up mom’s White Elephant gift card by buying a simple hair dryer. We then went next door where we found a huge american girl doll store that tempted me to buy one, but instead we bot chic clothes and a mini violin. We then found an alleyway that led to a food market like the Quincy Market in Boston that we decided to later keep in mind for dinner when dad came. When he finally arrived we showed him around and then had BBQ and Falafel at the market. Soon after we found a chic French boutique where we had a cake and sorbet dessert. Dad went home to rest and mom and I went to the Beverly Center where we tried to return a Macy’s Christmas gift and failed, leaving us to take a bathroom break before heading home and having a long slumber.
Until I wake,

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke to yet another avocado-and-cheese sandwich with a glass of cool milk. We then rushed to Grandma’s house to pick up Manesh, Manijeh Khanoom and Grandma. Manijeh Khanoom rewarded me for my good behavior of not staring at a screen all day by giving everyone rolet cake and for me a new pink and white handbag/purse. We went to Getty Villa where we watched a 10 minute intro about the buildings history (It was made to look like a lost ancient art filled building) before setting of to see some art. We saw clay sculptures and metal and stone statues and even tile pictures. When we went outside we say Getty’s art displayed around scenic ponds and gardens. We smelled and admired the herb garden representing how romans farmed and used herbs and we even took a few home to plant. Then after much arguing we decided to eat at the Getty cafe where I enjoyed a cup of mint tea that could be refilled up to 3 times and a spaghetti with meat. Soon after we enjoyed the family room where you pretended to be someone of that ancient time. I made rubbed images, drew and designed pots with marker and even interacted with ancient gladiators with my foam shield and sword, a war fought by your shadow on a projector. After that we drove our guest back to Grandma’s house and went home, where I practiced my violin and some Christmas songs from the mini violin’s book. Before I new it I couldn’t even keep my eyes open on at the end of this fulfilling day.
Until they open,

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had the pastry’s dad brought home from the store the other day for breakfast. Then we took Fluffy for a walk and stopped by a Petco to see if they had finally gotten the shoes we wanted to get her, that order had not yet arrived. We decided a Petco in Irvine would be cheaper and well stocked. We drove to Irvine as we had planned earlier and we were about to stop at Asal our favorite pastry store when we saw a Daiso Japan store that we had been searching for weeks for and immediately rushed in. We spent over an hour there admiring all the cute items, some time later we narrowed our search and but a few things we really wanted and might need. I got some Pocky, a cool pencil case with a built in sharpener, scented pens, puzzle erasers, nail polish and a animal wire holder. After that we went to Asal and got a fruit cake, a napolonie and a jello cake for dad. We feasted on our treats by a pond in Irvine surrounded by cute ducks that begged us for bread that we supplied them with. After that we went to Costa Mesa Mall to have our favorite Din Tai Fung Chinese food, that was as always packed, but this time to packed to get in. Instead we took a bathroom break and walked enjoying the mall before we started to get hungry. We went to the Royal Indian Cuisine that had an okay buffay we dined at and tea. After eating our Liner we went to a Petco to get Fluffy shoes that were the same price but were found with ease. (Later on they were found only one size too small) We, now late, rushed onto the freeway and hit not only the afternoon but also the Friday traffic, making the trip home longer, but a good opportunity to read.  When we got home we told dad of some of our travels before going for a quick walk and retiring for the night.

				Dear Blog,
Today we woke up and had mortadella, cucumber, tomato, cheese and bread sandwich for breakfast. We then had dad take Fluffy for a short walk before driving to the Descanso Garden. At the garden we first explored the Japanese garden that was full of hanging red lanterns marking plants. It also had a bridge that went over a large stream full of Koi fish, and even a a bamboo pipe contraption, like a lever, bringing water from the stream to a bubbling pot. We then hiked up the trail we thought would lead us to the top of the mountain. On the way we saw many flower plants (mostly roses) that were full of buds since there is good weather in LA ready to blossom in spring, which we thought would be a perfect time to come back and see the richly colored flowers. There were also many giant redwoods to see on our way towering over us, so big in fact that ferns were growing on its branches. When we were half way up the trail we ran into the Boddy house were the owner lived. It had his furniture and the timeline concluding the history of the park. Dad lifted me up so I could touch the top of the arch covered with roses. After that we say many flowers and even a sandy area with cactuses on our way down. We even came by a man made pond. At the end we followed the signs to the roses garden filled with roses of many colors and patterns. They even had 3D cylinder and rombis  metal shapes hanging from trees that you were allowed to gently spin while sunlight poured through the holes and reflected of the metal causing the fence to dance with its yellow flowing partner like a summer ball. We then passed by many cute plants on our way to the exit, were we stopped by the Gift Shop on our way to the car. When mom was looking up the gardens’ location so she would remember it THE T ROOM popped up on the screen and it was only a few miles away making and afternoon tea “meant to be”. It was even more “meant to be” because the place was open when we called and squeezed us into their schedule as the last person without a reservation for the day. If we had called a second later someone else out of the vast crowd of callers would have gotten our table. At the tea house I got mango tea in a white rainbow-looking pot. For my food I got nutella and other finger sandwiches such as cucumber and ham. And on the dessert tray I had almond cake and a macaroon. When we got our box the lady asked which desserts we liked the best before putting extra of those in our box. She even gave me a black and diamond head band. After that we took a quick bathroom break at home and dressed up before going to Flame for our reservation with Dr. Oz, dad’s boss and his wife. We talked and had Kabob and ice cream dessert (They gave me a heart necklace gift) before going home to sleep. I wrote in my diary until my eyes could no longer stay open.
Until New Year’s Eve,

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had the leftover boxed tea party sandwiches, cakes and macaroons we could not finish the day earlier. After that we drove to encino so I could be dropped off at Grandma’s house. She came down the stairs and escorted me to her apartment. I stayed from about 12:00 to 4:30. I watched TV had a lunch of spaghetti and tadique and a dessert of an ice cream sandwich she created from stuffing two round wafers with vanilla ice cream and using a spoon to round the edges. I even taught Grandma how to play mancala (we played two rounds).  After that mom and dad picked me up and took me to the Petco in the next store shopping center to return Fluffy’s 20$ shoes that were a size two small. We instead traded it out for a cute green sweater with white polka dots that was 20$ but 5 dollars off because of a recent sale giving us the ability to add some dog treats to the trade. We then went to the Flame restaurant we went to on the day former and ordered the same things because on the previous night since dad’s boss was there mom did not taste her food and did not enjoy it, and she was too shy to reach and grab certain food items. After eating a nice similar meal we went home and put the sweater on Fluffy. We then set up a game of Monopoly to play (that we only got half way through) while watching the New York Ball drop on TV. We had ice cream and I even made myself a homemade chocolate milk. In the end we decided to watch a movie that we chose to be BIG. I stayed up until New Year and when the clock struck 12:00 I sent all my friends and family a happy new year text/email that said “sent at 12:00” on it.
Until the Fireworks rest,

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up at 9:50am and I went to my bathroom to change. My dog found this a perfect opportunity to escape my bedroom and get the party started by waking up my parents. She only successfully woke mom. I took Fluffy back to her bed, but she followed me to the living room anyway. Once there I went into the kitchen and made myself a glass of milk and mom and dad coffee.I also laid out the utensils, plates and bread. Next to everyone’s plate I placed a favorite snack of theirs for New Year’s. For mom pumpkin seeds, for dad gum and for me Pocky.  A few minutes later Fluffy sneaked off and returned following awoken dad. He reminded me the Rose Parade was showing so I quickly found it on TV and recorded it just in case we missed anything. Once I got the rose parade ready I went back to the kitchen were to my disappointment all the setup I had put was gone. Instead we had the kabob leftovers on the table for breakfast and spaghetti with no Pocky in sight. After we started eating we decided to eat near the TV so we could also watch the Rose Parade. They had many different floats that were full of roses and dad even saw a sheriff he new riding on a horse in the cowboy section of the parade. We drove from the house thinking we would go to hollywood, soon after we changed our minds and went back for Fluffy so we could take a walk by the beach with her. After a long tiring walk we stopped by Blue Plate Taco where I had guacamole and chips and for my main course lobster Tacos.  I asked the waiter for a tortilla that he gladly handed to me. The pack of tortilla’s was fed to Fluffy who ate it with pure delight. We then walked home where dad went to the gym. Mom and dI grabbed our jump ropes and read some science before departing. Over there we saw Rob in the gym so we left to play basketball in the garage and then we came back after we left. Over there dad and I did weights and jump rope.When we got home I made a surprise sparkling water for when dad finished his shower. We played 3 rounds of Mancala before getting ready to sleep.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had cereal for breakfast. Then as planned, we went to Kaiser Permanente to pay for mom’s glasses prescription. While I waited I watched the game show playing on the TV. We then went to The Broad that we found out was not the building in picture one but in fact the building a street down in picture two. The broad had two big of a line, the sir said it would be a two hour wait and that at 2:00pm it is less busy. We decided to come back then. The next stop on our agenda was to go to Griffith Observatory. It was a long drive uphill and when we got there we could not find parking. The street guy said it was a fifteen minute walk uphill from where he stood. As our search for parking continued the 15min point kept getting farther out of sight until we were three mountains away and we still found no parking. We then found an empty lot and since we were so far off, and the road to the Observatory had no bike lane we gave up on going back and instead went hiking on a nearby hiking trail. After a short hike went down the mountain and we decided to go to a highly recommended bakery  called Porto’s. Over there I ordered a ham and cheese and lettuce sandwich with a croissant cover and a mango shake. Mom also ordered a few pastry’s. The wait was so long and dad’s “to go” food was given to us first in a box. We then sat down with our number 60 waiting for them to bring our “for here” food to us. It took so long we decided to have them give us the food “to go” since that food was prepared faster. Even that had a long wait and we both agreed no matter how great this food was we were never coming back there again. We then came home having the food for liner before settling down for bed. Mom braided all my hair for me.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had a rushed cereal with almonds. My mom and I then ran to the car and drove as fast as possible to her chiropractor appointment. While she was there I did all of my khan lessons needed for today. After that we drove to the ice skating rink called ICE on 5th street. I rented out my shoes and started by skating once around the large rink. I was a little rusty so I went to the mini rink to practice first. After I got the hang of it I went back to the large rink. Just when I was about to skate with no hands, and I was only 25% through the man on the speaker told us to get off the ice for a 10 minute resurfacing. When they do this the ice becomes harder and smoother. While they were doing this mom and me went to the ICE Gallery (the food store belonging to ICE) to get some food. We got a kids meal that included peas, lasagna-like-pizza, and squash that we could not find. All in all it was a good pizza that was soft and easy to scoop. By the time we finished the rink was opened. I went inside and skated, now able to let go of the wall but hover my had over it. We decided to go to the Thai place with coconuts for lunch and come back later for more skating. As we left we noticed that dad would come home soon and that he wanted persian food, so we stopped by Tehran Market. There we got stew and sulomi. We stopped by Vons to get baquet for the sandwiches but I was so tired (I almost had a headache) that I stayed in the car. When we got home I took a nap, and when I awoke the sandwiches were ready and the stews were warmed. Dad showed up a few minutes later and joined us at the diner table. After we ate we drove to Memorial Park for basketball. Afterwards I went skating again, showing off to dad before coming home to sleep.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had a Nutella sandwich. Then we rushed to get ready so we could beat the traffic. I made a bad with my phone, eligner case, jacket, highlighters, scented pens, planner, fruit, backup shoes, book and dictionary. First in the car I prepared the navigation and directed mom to the freeway. Once there I read some math from my book and science. Later on in the trip we took our first stop at a Mcdonald drive through where mom got a peppermint mocha and I got a hot fudge sundae. I then read a greek mythology story and half of another. We then continued our drive and soon enough we had arrived. Once there we parked our car on the roof and it began to drizzle, so I switched my shoes, grabbed a hat and ran into the elevator. We found an alleyway that was full of cute stores, restaurants and statues. In the center was a pond with two turtles swimming in it. On the rocks were many turtles that did not move. I assumed those were fake but mom said they looked to real, so we went to a store to as a lady if they were real, and they were. I stared at them and saw one blink wich shocked me. Then one moved its head causing the one on top of it to fall over, so they were real just very slow. When we exited the alleyway we walked the streets. We observed that most stores were gone and that this could not be the main street. We stopped by yet another Mcdonald’s, where we took a bathroom break.  Then I remembered I forgot to take my Hotel Californian card down. We passed by a cute store where they made door wreaths with cactuses growing out of them. Now looking for a lunch place it started raining so we went back to our car. We navigated to Hotel California where we found the main street and a nice place to eat, the hotel cafe. Once there I had a spaghetti with tomato sauce, chili peppers (that mom ate), and lamb. It was spicy but a good combination. Mom had the same fruity but nuty parfa she had last time she was here, and it was still delightful. After that we walked to the pier and admired the ocean before driving home. On the way home I read Science. It was explaining why ice floats in water when it was a solid and ice is a liquid. Then dad called and started having a boring conversation about his work with mom so I used my highlighters and scented pens to decorate my planner. I then read the other half of the story, and before I knew it I was home. After basketball we went to Staples to by a wire and then we went to Ralfs to buy the supplies we needed for tomorrow's cooking.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had a salami sandwich for breakfast. Then we prepared the ingredients for lasagna. I set the table with three wine glasses for our smoothie and three plates for the lasagna. We first made the lasagna by putting nine pasta layers in boiling water, and placing onions in a saucepan. We then added spices, oil and garlic. Next we dropped pieces of meat in the center of the so it would stay warm. After much stirring we added the sauce and some veggies to absorb the extra juice. We then drained the water from the past bowl and placed two pasta’s in the tray. Next we layer meat and sauce over it and last but not least I sprinkled some cheese. We followed those steps for quite some time before the pan was full and we left it on the table. Meanwhile while the sauce had been cooking we took the brownie mix, and followed the instructions. After laying out the batter we set it in the oven to cook for 20 minutes. As it finished cooking we say the lasagna sauce was ready. After following the previous steps I mentioned we placed the lasagna in the oven and put the brownies out to cool. At that time we cleaned the kitchen. Then we cut the brownie’s and laid them decorated in a China plate on the table. When the lasagna had finished cooking we left it in the oven to stay warm because dad was coming home soon. We decided to make our smoothie. We washed our berries and put them in the blender. The berries were sour and we decided would not mix well with milk so we decided instead to skip the milk and just put strawberry ice cream. It turned out tasting fine and we put it in the fridge to stay fresh. Right when dad was about to come home we ran outside to take Fluffy for a quick walk. When we got back he was already home so we set out the lasagna and feasted. That night we watched a movie called Leap! about a girl in an orphanage that had a dream to become a dancer and she and her best friend escape together to follow their dream. She wants to become a ballerina and he wants to become a great inventor.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had a mortadella sandwich with tomatoes, cheese and cucumbers. Then my mom, dad and I drove to Knott’s Berry Farm where we parked and walked in. We searched for a baby snoopy for Fluffy, but they did not have one. We entered the park and decided to go to Ghost Town where we encountered the mining ⛏ ride. In there we were in a mining train/cart going through an underground tunnel passing by miners. Our second ride was similar but instead we were in a log boat suspended in water the whole way. We say miners in that ride too but it had drops in a the dark and light like a roller coaster. After that we settled down in the Knott’s cafe where I enjoyed a quarter rack of ribs with the side of Mac and cheese plus corn. After that we admired the fair games and arcade before I played one myself and won a dog toy for Fluffy. Now, in Snoopy Town we went to the hot air balloon ride. As I waited I played on the wobbly bridges. When our turn finally came mom and I rode on the Charlie Brown colored balloon while dad was on an opposite one. While we rode we took pictures of each other up and down. When the ride finished we took a bathroom break before deciding to find a place to eat ice cream and coffee. We came upon a gold panning area where I panned for gold and got ten real pieces! We then stopped by a cake shop that I saw a cake shaped like the tree in the Charlie Brown Christmas Movie. We took a bathroom break and left the park. Outside I got a butter pecan ice cream on the cone. It was supposed to be one scoop but they gave me way more. We peeked in the cute stores on the way to our car and then we went home. There we put our stuff down, changed and took Fluffy for two walks before driving to Flame for dinner. I had some of dad’s kabob, yogurt plus bread and tadique with stew. In the end we went home and slept.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up early and had an egg with my choice of pastry. I had a bite of napoleon, chocolate cake and tube cake. As planned we went down stairs to pump up my bike for our ride. The pump was broken so we walked to the beach where we filled it at the bike store before biking to the Hulu bike stand. There we got two bikes for mom and dad. We rode north and after a long ride we came back, south to the Hulu stand. Dropping off the two bikes we walked mine back up to our house. We took the extra kabob and stew from Flame out of the fridge and warmed it for lunch. After lunch we all settled down and had an afternoon nap. This way my legs would no longer be tired for our planned ice skating. At the rink we noticed this was the last day to state before it closed. I first stayed to the edge trying to avoid puddles but before long we were kicked out so the could clear the ice. Once on again I stayed to the edge occasionally letting go of my hand and soon did a whole round with No hands. Then I went to the mini rink where I crossed side to side practicing my technique. Later I went back on the large rink officially learned how to scare. We left very satisfied. Since I could no longer practice the skill with the rink closed we decided to later on by me roller skates so I could keep the skill from rusting but on a surface that was available in all seasons. We stopped by Thai Vegan where we had a chow mein and two veggie soups. We then went back home where we first took Fluffy for a walk before working out in the gym. Once home I showered and created my locker mailbox out of paper and a plastic cup before retiring to my bed.

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke up and had cereal for breakfast. Then, in the rain, me and mom went to Kaiser Permanente to get moms vitamins and then to another where we got moms cute glasses. Then we went to Big 5 where we got our planned roller skates so i can practice the skill. We used our coupon for 10$ off there. After a quick bathroom break. We stopped by Amadine for lunch where I had a turnkey and avocado sandwich on croissant. Once full and sleepy we went home and searched through my room for any old or forgotten games to play. We found World Monument but it was too complicated so we put it away. Then dad called saying he would come home soon so we ordered Grubhub (PF Chang) for dinner. I enjoyed the California rolls and honey shrimp with rice. We then went to basketball where I played very well and made many hoops before going home. I organized my binder preparing everything for school and even putting cute decor on my planner. In conclusion this was the best Mom and me vacation ever.
Until next Bloggers,
