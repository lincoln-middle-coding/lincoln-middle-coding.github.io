Dear Blog,
Today we woke up and had light cereal and oatmeal for breakfast. Then we got in the car and drove on ocean street south through all the beaches until we reached Marina del Rey. Here we searched for a place to have clam chowder for breakfast. We reached a fork in the road and we took the path to Fisherman’s Wharf. There my mom and I parked the car and took a walk around the stores while admiring the seals and giant pelicans. We came upon a cute restaurant called Whisky Red that was said to have clam chowder, so we went there. To enter you crossed a bridge surrounded by koi fish. Inside there was a glass room with a table having a perfect ocean view that we occupied. I got a lemonade that I put in my to go Starbucks cup, while mom had a coffee. We ordered two enjoyable clam chowders, but the calamari was soggy and thick, which we returned. We then walked around in pursuit of a nice gift shop but they were all closed so we went to The Point mall. There we saw metal statues and we took a bathroom break. On the way home we stopped by an in-and-out where we got a milkshake a burger and French fries that our waiter had almost mistaken to have no salt. As we departed home we told dad of our travels before having a Panini dinner and finishing the night with a game of Mancala. 
Until tomorrow,
Melodie

				Dear Blog,
Today we woke up and ate a scrumptious breakfast of avocado-and-cheese sandwich with a glass of cold milk. Then we rushed out of the house to reach my Physical Therapist in time. Soon after, we drove to downtown LA where we skipped our planned visit to The Broad Museum that had a huge line and instead we went to The Grove. The parking had a red carpet and  an alleyway leading to the main attraction. We first explored the area to find our way around. We went on the bridge over the pond and found a statue of a boy fishing. Behind the pond was a giant Christmas tree and a Santa Claus riding a sled airborne attached with wires. We found a cute cafe where I saved us a sofa window seat while mom bought the pastry’s, and later a smore that I discovered a kid eating. The smore was on a neatly cut stick, and was torched in front of you. It was filled with cold vanilla ice cream surrounded with chocolate wafer and marshmallow. After the treat we found a Sephora where we used up mom’s White Elephant gift card by buying a simple hair dryer. We then went next door where we found a huge american girl doll store that tempted me to buy one, but instead we bot chic clothes and a mini violin. We then found an alleyway that led to a food market like the Quincy Market in Boston that we decided to later keep in mind for dinner when dad came. When he finally arrived we showed him around and then had BBQ and Falafel at the market. Soon after we found a chic French boutique where we had a cake and sorbet dessert. Dad went home to rest and mom and I went to the Beverly Center where we tried to return a Macy’s Christmas gift and failed, leaving us to take a bathroom break before heading home and having a long slumber.
Until I wake,
Melodie

				Dear Blog,
Today I woke to yet another avocado-and-cheese sandwich with a glass of cool milk. We then rushed to Grandma’s house to pick up Manesh, Manijeh Khanoom and Grandma. Manijeh Khanoom rewarded me for my good behavior of not staring at a screen all day by giving everyone rolet cake and for me a new pink and white handbag/purse. We went to Getty Villa where we watched a 10 minute intro about the buildings history (It was made to look like a lost ancient art filled building) before setting of to see some art. We saw clay sculptures and metal and stone statues and even tile pictures. When we went outside we say Getty’s art displayed around scenic ponds and gardens. We smelled and admired the herb garden representing how romans farmed and used herbs and we even took a few home to plant. Then after much arguing we decided to eat at the Getty cafe where I enjoyed a cup of mint tea that could be refilled up to 3 times and a spaghetti with meat. Soon after we enjoyed the family room where you pretended to be someone of that ancient time. I made rubbed images, drew and designed pots with marker and even interacted with ancient gladiators with my foam shield and sword, a war fought by your shadow on a projector. After that we drove our guest back to Grandma’s house and went home, where I practiced my violin and some Christmas songs from the mini violin’s book. Before I new it I couldn’t even keep my eyes open on at the end of this fulfilling day.
Until they open,
Melodie

				Dear BLog,
Today I woke up and had the pastry’s dad brought home from the store the other day for breakfast. Then we took Fluffy for a walk and stopped by a Petco to see if they had finally gotten the shoes we wanted to get her, that order had not yet arrived. We decided a Petco in Irvine would be cheaper and well stocked. We drove to Irvine as we had planned earlier and we were about to stop at Asal our favorite pastry store when we saw a Daiso Japan store that we had been searching for weeks for and immediately rushed in. We spent over an hour there admiring all the cute items, some time later we narrowed our search and but a few things we really wanted and might need. I got some Pocky, a cool pencil case with a built in sharpener, scented pens, puzzle erasers, nail polish and a animal wire holder. After that we went to Asal and got a fruit cake, a napolonie and a jello cake for dad. We feasted on our treats by a pond in Irvine surrounded by cute ducks that begged us for bread that we supplied them with. After that we went to Costa Mesa Mall to have our favorite Din Tai Fung Chinese food, that was as always packed, but this time to packed to get in. Instead we took a bathroom break and walked enjoying the mall before we started to get hungry. We went to the Royal Indian Cuisine that had an okay buffay we dined at and tea. After eating our Liner we went to a Petco to get Fluffy shoes that were the same price but were found with ease. (Later on they were found only one size too small) We, now late, rushed onto the freeway and hit not only the afternoon but also the Friday traffic, making the trip home longer, but a good opportunity to read.  When we got home we told dad of some of our travels before going for a quick walk and retiring for the night.
Until the sun rises,
Melodie
