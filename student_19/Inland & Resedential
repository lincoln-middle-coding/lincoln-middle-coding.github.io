	<li> <h3> Rock Dove </h3>  </li>

<p>The Rock Dove is one of the most common (and annoying) birds in all of Santa Monica. You can find it in crowded areas within Santa Monica, such as the 3rd street Promenade or at the Pier. Rock Doves will eat anything that is given to them such as restaurant leftovers. The Rock Dove can be seen in many other colors, such as white, brown, and mixed. The Rock dove typically ranges from 29-37 cm in length and 62-72 cm wingspan. The wight of the Rock dove ranges between 8.4-13.5 oz.</p>

	<li> <h3> Mourning Dove </h3> </li>
<p> In Santa Monica, the Mourning Dove is also quite common but also more attractive as compared to the Rock Dove. It is found mostly on wires, around homes, and at bird feeders.You can hear the doves soft mourning sound if you listen closely, near them. If you would like to feed them, their preferable food that they eat would be: corn, millet, and sunflower seeds. Mourning doves are about 31cm in length, 45cm in wingspan, and 4-6 oz in weight.</p>

	<li> <h3> California Scrub-Jay </h3> </li>
<p>The California Scrub-Jay is the only Jay in Santa Monica. They are mostly found at homes who offer them food, parks, and feeders. From my experience, the California Scrub-Jays most favorable foods are peanuts. I have tried other seeds but they only pick at them. The Scrub-Jay is 27-31 cm in length and has a 39cm wingspan. It weighs at a light 2.8 oz. They are not very scared of humans if they know that you give them food.</p>

They, like the Rock dove eat anything that is given to them and do not have a preferable food.They hang around trash cans, alley ways, and telephone wires. They are 40-53 cm in length, their wingspan can be from 85-100 cm, and they weigh 11.1-22.0 oz. They can even live up to 30 years.</p>

		<li> <h3> California Quail </h3> </li>
<p>The California Quail is one of the most beautiful and rare birds in Santa Monica. You can tell them apart from any other bird because of their distinct feather on top of their head. I have only seen a California Quail a handful of times at my house, you will have a better chance of finding them near the mountains. The females are less colorful and have a shorter feather on the top of their head. The length of the Quail is an average 25 cm and weighs 5-7 oz.</p>

		<li> <h3> Anna's Hummingbird </h3> </li>
<p>The Anna's Hummingbird is the most common hummingbird in Santa Monica. If you buy a hummingbird feeder, they will be there within an hour and will keep on going there until the nectar. The Anna's Hummingbird is 10-11 cm long and have a 12 cm wingspan. They are also very light weighing at 0.10-0.20 oz.</p>

		<li> <h3> Red-Winged Blackbird </h3> </li>
<p>I have to admit that this bird is quite difficult to find in Santa Monica (I have only seen it once at my home). The best way to find the blackbird is to go to the Santa Monica Mountains or Malibu, and look for their distinct red wing (only males) when they are flying. They are between 22-25 cm long and gave a wingspan of 30-37 cm. They weigh 1.4-1.5 oz. Females are a mix of white, black, and brown.</p>
