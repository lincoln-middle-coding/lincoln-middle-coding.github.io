Over winter break, I celebrated Christmas with my family. Then we went to Sam Fransisco.
 After we got back I just hung out around Santa Monica. I was on Instagram and YouTube most of the time. My break was pretty cool.
 I read Harry Potter an dthe Deathly Hallows and watched Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. And finally I saw my friends and family.
