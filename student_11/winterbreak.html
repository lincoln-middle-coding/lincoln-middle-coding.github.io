Over winter break, I celebrated Christmas with my family. Then we went to Sam Fransisco.
 After we got back I just hung out around Santa Monica. I was on Instagram and YouTube most of the time. My break was pretty cool.
 I read Harry Potter an dthe Deathly Hallows and watched Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. And finally I saw my friends and family. 
 STORYTIME
 There Once was a girl named Carrie. Carrie Potter. Her parents were taken by the greatest dark witch of all time, Lestrenge. Carrie was taken in by her very mean aunt and uncle, 
 Rose and Venon Dursley. Carrie was no ordinary girl. She could make things happen without her meaning to make them happen. She could talk to snakes, too. One day, her evil cousin duddy 
 had a birthday at the zoo. They all went to the reptile department. Duddy saw the biggest snake there, a Boa Constricor. She got so excited, becausse she absolutely loved Boa Constricors!
 Not Carrie. She hated them. But it was Duddy's birthday, and Uncle Venon had told Carrie to be nice to Duddy, or else she would be locked in her room for a full month. Cazrrie gazed at the Huge 
 Snake with fear in her eyes. Suddenly, the snake hissed amd slithered toward her.
