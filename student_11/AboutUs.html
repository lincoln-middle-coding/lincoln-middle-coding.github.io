Hi! I'm Shiro, the pilot of the black lion and commander of team voltron. I was on a mission to PLuto's moon, Kerberos, when I was captured. But I was rescued, and transported through space along with pidge, Keith, Lamce, and Hunk. We then landed on planed Altea, where I joined team Voltron.

Hey, I'm Pidge, pilot of the green lion. I was at space training school with Lance and Hunk, when we escaped one night, rescued Shiro, picked up Keith, and soared through space to planet Altea, where we all joined team Voltron.

Helloo, I'm Lance, pilot of the blue lion. I work with Pidge, Hunk, Shiro, Allura, Koran, and Keith on voltron, the defender of the universe.

Hi. I'm Kewith, pilot of the red lion. I was at space training school, but I ran away. I tried to save Shiro, but Lance got there and ruined my spot of victory. Anyway, I work with the rest of team Voltron to defend the universe and try to stop the Gallra empire from taking over the Universe. 

Hi there, I'm hunk, pilot of the yellow lion. There's not a lot to say about me, because the rest of the guys already said it, but I loove space food.
