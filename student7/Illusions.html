    <h1>The truth of llusions: To be honset, it depends on the type of person. If you're the mature kind of person, it means you can't 
    perceive illsions that well and you're easily tricked.(That isn't bad though! Studies show that if you are this kind of 
    person, you are very mature!)If you can percieve illusions in less than 20 seconds, you have an adaptable mind and can easily 
    switch from one setting to another! If you can do it under five settings, you are ABOVE AVERAGE and have the mind of A TODDLER!
    But thats not bad either!</h1>
