<h1>Want to hear about super cool technology reports? What you will read below with include ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, NEW WAYS OF 
TRANSPORTATION, COOL GADGETS AND MORE!!</h1>

<br><h2> Shoud we be scared of Artificial Intelligence taking over the world?- Before we get into the reports on AI, you may not know what that is. Artificial Intelligence are
human brains that have been made by us. Or at least replicas that don't look like, just think like it. Scientists have just figured out 
  how to make AI, and now are converting it into robots.</h2>

       <h3> An AI bot sitting here marveling over the existence of life.</h3>
  <br><h2>Artificial Intelligence has it's share of plus and minuses. To some people, AI may sound wonderful. Just imagine. You can have the bot do all the chores
  for you, make a living for you, order pizza and have it bring it back to you. You could even have the bot protect you! But if the whole system glitches, it may lead to the destruction
  of human being existence. For example, a highly advanced bot once admitted it wanted to destroy all humans. That was bad. And robots destroyig humans isn't the worst.
  Something that will be practically impossible for scientists to fix is economy. Robots would put buisnesses out of buisness and lots of people would stop making money. But in the
  future, that can be fixed. Artificial Intelligence will have tons of rough bumps, but just imagine not having to go to work or school...</h2>
