<p>My name is Max and I am 11 years old.</p>
<b> </b>
<p>I have no siblings but I do have 1 pet!</p>
<b> </b>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy flying drones! (This is why I made this website!)</p>
<p>When I grw up I want to become a preoffessional drone flier and a coder!</p>
<p>Some of my favorite foods are: 
Pasta   
Chicken Soup
Sushi</p>
<p>I definitly don't like:
    wierd and creepy foods
    I am so excited to make Drone Space a reality. But we need your support first. Go to Contact Us if you haven't already and email or call me for more information about this new website.</p>
