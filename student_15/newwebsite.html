   <DJI’s new Osmo Mobile smartphone stabilizer is way cheaper than the original>
<DJI is introducing a new version of its smartphone stabilizer, the Osmo Mobile, that makes a handful of small changes to the original as well as one big one: its price. The Osmo Mobile 2 will start at $129, making it much more affordable than the original model (which started at $299, though you can find it now for closer to $200) as a way to keep your phone shake-free while shooting video.

The Osmo Mobile 2 doesn’t change the formula very much. As far as upgrades go, there’s really only one big one — though it’s a notable one: the new model has full support for shooting in portrait. The original model could shoot in portrait, but you had to hold the stabilizer sideways, which wasn’t always ideal. The new model can actually be mounted in portrait, which should make using it more comfortable and flexible since you can still hold the grip upright.
Otherwise, little has changed for this new version. The Osmo Mobile 2 is made of “high performance nylon” instead of a mixture of nylon and magnesium alloy, making the whole thing ever-so-slightly lighter (though it’s mostly imperceptible in use). The buttons have been tweaked a bit for simplicity, and the accessory mount has been moved to the bottom of the grip, instead of the side.

DJI has now switched to an internal battery, too, instead of using replaceable ones, which should be a good thing if it lives up to the company’s estimates. Instead of the estimated 3 to 4.5 hours the original got from one battery, the new model is supposed to get up to 15 hours of battery on a single charge. The lack of support for replacements could put filmmakers in a bind if it suddenly dies out; but if it actually lasts for anywhere close to 15 hours, that probably won’t happen all that often.

The Osmo Mobile 2 is supposed to launch sometime next month, with pre-orders starting January 23rd, exclusively through Apple at first. DJI says the stabilizer should support most popular phones, so devices as large and heavy as a Plus-sized iPhone or Android phone should be fine.

Correction January 7th, 6:41PM ET: The original Osmo Mobile did support shooting in portrait, however it didn’t support mounting the phone in portrait, like the new model does.>
