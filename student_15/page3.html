Techniques for advanced flies!
        <p> </p>

1. The most simple technique is giong up while the camera is facing down. This shows the whole area surrounding the subject or the point of interest.
<p> </p>
2. The next technique that I am going to teach you is going up while also moving back and at the same time keeping the camera on the subject or point of interest.
<p> </p>
3. Another technique that I have learned is getting really close to an inadiment object and going up while pulling the camera down to face the object. (This works well on a tree as the oject).
<p> </p>
4. This next technique is the exact oposite of the previous one which is to get really close to the object but now go down from where you left off which should be higher than the object and as your going down tilt the camera up to face the object. (This als oworks really well on a tree as the object).
<p> </p>
5. For this next one make sure someone's watching you so your drone doesn't crash. (Preferebly someone who knows how to fly the drone well). Make sure you get close to the object fist so you can see that it is right above the object. Then throttle far back and speed it as fast as you can foward towards the oject. (This is good to use on a house or a tree. Agian make sure not to crash your drone with this technique)!
